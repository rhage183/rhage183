## Hi there 👋


With a PhD in Physics and a background in AI material research, I retrained as a Data Scientist to properly leverage data's role in innovation.

🔭 I'm currently working on a Reinforcement Learning project ([from-a-to-b-with-rl](https://github.com/rhage183/from-a-to-b-with-rl))

🌱 I’m currently learning Tensorflow, ScikitLearn and Pytorch

👯 I am looking to lend a hand on data science projects that you might need help with

If you do, don't hesistate:
