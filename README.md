## Hi there ğŸ‘‹


With a PhD in Physics and a background in AI material research, I retrained as a Data Scientist to properly leverage data's role in innovation.

ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on a Reinforcement Learning project ([from-a-to-b-with-rl](https://github.com/rhage183/from-a-to-b-with-rl))

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Tensorflow, ScikitLearn and Pytorch
