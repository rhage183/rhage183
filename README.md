## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With a PhD in physics and several years of experience in academia, I specialized in research focused on developing new materials for AI applications. Recognizing the growing importance of data in driving innovation, I decided to switch careers and immerse myself in the world of AI. To make this transition, I completed an intensive retraining program and am now a qualified data scientist.

I am now looking to contribute on data science projects to keep active. Let me know if I can help.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a Reinforcement Learning project ([from-a-to-b-with-rl](https://github.com/rhage183/from-a-to-b-with-rl))

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Tensorflow, ScikitLearn and Pytorch

ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to lend a hand on data science projects that you might need help with

If you do, don't hesitate:
